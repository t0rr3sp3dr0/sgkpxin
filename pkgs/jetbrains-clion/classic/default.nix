      CLion is a smart cross-platform IDE for developing in C and C++ built on
      the IntelliJ platform. It brings coding assistance, on-the-fly code
      analysis with quick-fixes, and safe and automated refactorings to C and
      C++ developers on all three major platforms (Linux, Windows, and macOS).
      It fits local and remote development workflows as well as the development
      of embedded systems.

      Supported languages and technologies
      C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Rust, Python, CMake, Makefile, Gradle
