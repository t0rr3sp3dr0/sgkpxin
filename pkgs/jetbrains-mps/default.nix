      MPS is an open source IDE for developing external domain-specific
      languages (DSLs). MPS began as a research prototype with the goal of
      changing the paradigm of how programming is done. Now it is being used
      every day to solve complex real-world problems. Our clients are using it
      across a diverse spectrum of areas, ranging from the automotive and
      healthcare industries to tax return calculation for an entire country.
      
      Supported languages and technologies
      DSLs
